Project 1: Shell

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive shell interface that enhances process control, user interaction, and error handling mechanism

## Division of Labor

### Part 1: Prompt 
- **Responsibilities**: The user will be greeted with a prompt that should indicate the absolute working directory, the user name, and the machine name. You can do this by expanding the $USER, $MACHINE, $PWD environment variables. The user will type on the same line as the prompt.
- **Assigned to**: Kirra Orndorff

### Part 2: Environment Variables
- **Responsibilities**: replacing tokens prefixed with the dollar sign character ($) with their corresponding values.
- **Assigned to** Kate Payen

### Part 3: Tilde Expansion
- **Responsibilities**: In Bash, tilde (~) may appear at the beginning of a path, and it expands to the environment variable $HOME
- **Assigned to** Ludginie Dorval

### Part 4: $PATH Search 
- **Responsibilities**: To perform the search, you will need to employ string operations to extract and examine each directory in the $PATH variable. In the event that the command is not found in any of the directories listed in $PATH, an error message should be displayed
- **Assigned to**: Kirra Orndorff

### Part 5: External Command Execution
- **Responsibilities**: Once you have obtained the path to the program you intend to execute, either because the command included a slash or through the $PATH search, the next step is to execute the external command. However, executing an external command requires more than just a single line of code using the execv() function.

To accomplish this, a two-step process is involved. First, you need to fork() to create a child process. The child process will be responsible for executing the desired command using the execv() function. This separation between the parent and child processes ensures that the execution of the command does not interfere with the operation of the shell itself.

It's important to note that you must handle commands with arguments correctly. This means that commands such as "ls -al" with multiple arguments should be properly processed and executed in the child process.

By following this approach of forking and executing the command within the child process, you can ensure the proper execution of external commands, including those with arguments, within your shell. This separation of processes allows for efficient and accurate command execution while maintaining the stability and functionality of the shell as a whole.

### Part 6: I/O Redirection
- **Responsibilities**: 
- **Assigned to** Ludginie Dorval

### Part 7: Piping
- **Responsibilities**: piping involves the simultaneous execution of multiple commands, with the input and output of these commands interconnected. This setup allows the output generated by the initial command to be seamlessly passed as input to the subsequent command. In this project, we will handle a maximum of two pipes in any given command

### Part 8: Background Processing

- **Assigned to** Kate Payen

### Part 9: Internal Command Execution

- **Assigned to** Ludginie Dorval

## File Listing
```
## How to Compile & Execute

### Requirements
- **Compiler**: e.g., `gcc` for C/
### Compilation

C was used for this project, so just run "make" in the starter directory:

shell/starter
make
```
This will build the executable in ...
### Execution
```bash
make run
```
This will run the program ...

```bash
./bin/shell
```

## Meetings
Document in-person meetings, their purpose, and what was discussed.

| Date       | Attendees            | Topics Discussed | Outcomes / Decisions |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 2025-09-17 | Kirra, Kate, Ludginie            | How to combine our parts to fit together  | use lexer.c file as the main project file |
| 2025-09-24 |  Kirra, Kate, Ludginie  | How to implement each other's parts in other's code; Any help/questions along with goals for completion and testing dates| work the bits of our own code into other's functions/main() function; project finished by saturday with testing on Saturday and Sunday  |


## Bugs
- **Bug 1**: "execv: no file or directory" after every command ran in shell (FIXED)
- **Bug 2**: double printing lines (FIXED)

## Extra Credit
- **Extra Credit 1:**: Added Piping for any number of commands - Kirra Orndorff
- **Extra Credit 2:**: [Extra Credit Option]
- **Extra Credit 3:**: [Extra Credit Option]

## Considerations
- only a rudimentary version of the shell; some outputs will not be the exact same as the testing version from professor
- user has correct input
